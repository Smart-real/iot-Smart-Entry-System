### 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a distributed IoT ecosystem designed to automate room entry, ambient lighting, and legacy hardware with sub-50ms latency. It orchestrates two microcontrollers (ESP32 & ESP8266) to create a **synchronized environment**—managing physical access via a custom Active IR Tripwire while simultaneously modernizing non-smart devices (RGB Strips) into a cohesive smart home node.

Unlike standard smart plugs, this system utilizes a **custom IR "Heartbeat" protocol** for noise-immune presence detection and implements a **non-blocking architecture** to maintain instant physical response times even during heavy Wi-Fi activity.

**Status:** ✅ Active / Stable v2.1

### ⚙️ Key Features
* **Dual-Node Sync:** Distributed logic between Door (Receiver) and Desk (Emitter) allows the environment to react instantly to human presence.
* **Smart Extension Hub:** Pivoted from controlling a single bulb to retrofitting a mains extension cord. This transforms the unit into a "Smart Hub," allowing modular control of multiple devices (Main Lamp, 5V RGB Drivers, Chargers) simultaneously.
* **Legacy Hardware Modernization:** Automated "State Recovery" logic overrides the chaotic default flash modes of cheap RGB strips on boot, restoring user presets (Purple/Solid) without physical remotes.
* **Hardware-Level PWM:** Offloaded 38kHz IR signal generation to the ESP8266 hardware timer, decoupling signal stability from CPU load (Wi-Fi/Blynk tasks).
* **Anti-Jitter Algorithm:** Implemented a "Smart Latch" timer to distinguish between a lingering person and a re-entry event.

### 🔧 Engineering Journey & Technical Challenges

#### 1. The Sensor Evolution (PIR vs. Active IR)
The project began as a feasibility study to understand relay logic, initially intending to use Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors. However, testing revealed significant latency and broad detection zones unsuitable for a precise "Tripwire."

I pivoted to an **Active IR Tripwire** mechanism:
* **Problem:** Standard photodiodes were hypersensitive to ambient noise (sunlight), causing false triggers.
* **Solution:** Upgraded to **TSOP-style receivers** (VS1838B) with internal gain control and band-pass filters.

#### 2. The "Continuous Signal" Fallacy
A major hurdle involved the TSOP receiver logic.
* **The Bug:** Driving the IR Emitter with a continuous DC signal failed because TSOP receivers are designed to filter out non-modulated signals as "interference."
* **The Fix:** Re-engineered the emitter logic to generate **modulated 38kHz packets**, establishing a stable link that only breaks upon physical obstruction.

#### 3. The "Resource War" (Tripwire vs. RGB Control)
Integrating the Desk Underglow created a critical resource conflict.
* **The Conflict:** The ESP8266 has limited hardware timers. Generating the continuous 38kHz tripwire signal (`analogWrite`) clashed with the precise timing required to send NEC IR codes (`IRremote`) to the LED strip, causing the lights to lag or fail.
* **The Optimization:** Implemented a **"Mutex" (Mutual Exclusion)** strategy. The system briefly pauses the 38kHz carrier wave (~50ms) to transmit LED color commands cleanly, then immediately resumes the tripwire. This ensures reliable lighting control without compromising security.

#### 4. Design Pivot: The "Smart Hub" Architecture
Early iterations focused on a custom enclosure for a single light bulb. I realized this lacked scalability and utility relative to the engineering effort.
* **The Pivot:** I retrofitted a standard AC extension cord by placing the Relay Module inline with the main input Live rail.
* **The Result:** A scalable IoT node that can control any plugged-in device, future-proofing the system for additional peripherals (chargers, heaters, etc.) without hardware redesigns.
